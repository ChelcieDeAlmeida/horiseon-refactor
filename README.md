# **HORISEON CODE REFACTOR**


## **_Description of the project_**
I was asked to refactor Horiseon's website's code to ensure maximum accessibility and to adhere to the best coding practices and standards using HTML & CSS3. The Mockup below should illustrate the final product as realized by the code in this repository.
